Last week, I had the amazing opportunity to attend to Reactive Summit 2017 on Austin, Texas and the previous 3-day workshop: "Lightbend Reactive Architecture".

## Lightbend Reactive Architecture

I'd totally recommend take this course as an introduction to Reactive Microservices. During my internship there were a lot of things I learned, and a lot of things that weren't clear, so basically I just skipped some concepts. By doing this, I was capable of get my hands right on the code. However, in this workshop I finally understand it, topics like: Sharding, CRDTs, software spectrum. My favorite slide is this one:

```
Reactive programming vs reactive tools: Using reactive tools doesn't make your software reactive.
```

Though I couldn't attend all the talks (some of them were at the same time), I found many of the talks really interesting: Akka anti-patterns, Mesosphere. And I finally could met all my mentors (Tim, Ignasi and James) and my co-intern Ruchika.
