Last week, I had the amazing opportunity to attend to Reactive Summit 2017 on Austin, Texas and the previous 3-day workshop: "Lightbend Reactive Architecture".

## Lightbend Reactive Architecture

I'd totally recommend take this course as an introduction to Reactive Microservices. During my internship there were a lot of things I learned, and a lot of things that weren't clear, so basically I just skipped some concepts. By doing this, I was capable of get my hands right on the code. However, in this workshop I finally understand it, topics like: Sharding, CRDTs, software spectrum. My favorite slide is this one:

Facts:

- I attended to the 3-days workshop: Lightbend Reactive Architecture
    - Reactive programming vs reactive tools: Using reactive tools doesn't make your software reactive.
    - CP vs AP (Sharding and CRDT)
- I attended to the conference:
    - Registration, exhibition
    - List some talks: Akka anti-patterns, Mesosphere

<!-- Tengo la certeza de que los 150 participantes aprendieron algo nuevo cada dÃ­a durante su estancia en la ciudad. -->
