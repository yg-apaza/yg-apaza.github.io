My name is Yuliana Apaza, and I'm an open source enthusiast, so far I joined to [Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2017/MayAugust#Lagom) program with Lagom. I'm also looking for new opportunities in research. Currently, I'm part of a research group on augmented reality.

See my current and past work on my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/yuliana-apaza-resume.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. You can contact me at yuliana.apaza94@gmail.com

I'm always learning something new.
